# Homework 1

This project involves two programming tasks focusing on visualizing the Hoeffding bound and implementing the Nearest Neighbor (NN) algorithm on the MNIST dataset.

# Homework 2

This project involves studying the hypothesis class of a finite union of disjoint intervals and the properties of the ERM algorithm for this class.

# Homework 3

This project involves implementing the back-propagation algorithm for training a neural network using the MNIST dataset. The network uses ReLU activations and cross-entropy loss to classify handwritten digits.

## Files:
- `backprop_data.py`: Loads the MNIST data.
- `backprop_network.py`: Implements the neural network functionality (including back-propagation).
- `backprop_main.py`: Provides examples of loading data, training the neural network, and evaluating the model on a test set.
